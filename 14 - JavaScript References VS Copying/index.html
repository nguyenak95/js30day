    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let abc = players;
    console.log(abc);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    abc[1] ="Khang";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,abc);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let abc2 = [...players];
    abc2[1] = "An";
    console.log(abc2,players);
    // one way
    let abc3 = Array.from(players);
    abc3[0] = "Khang";
    console.log(abc3,players);

    let abc4 = players.slice();
    let abc5 = [].concat(players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let hocsinh = {
        ten:"Khang",
        tuoi:12,
        diem: {
            Toan:9,
            Ly:10
        }
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let hocsinh1 = Object.assign({},hocsinh);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    let hocsinh1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(hocsinh));
